# Portolio Website using HTML and CSS

This is my portfolio website made using HTML and CSS. 

The HTML has three <code>sections</code> which has several <code>divs</code> in them. I also had a header and a foooter section. 

In the CSS I have used the <code>flex</code> and <code>box</code> container to style the page.
